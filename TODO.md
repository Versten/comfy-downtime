# TODO

### Apply ACE Cargo to fortification Objects
Provide a very basic systems for Making Various Objects Loadable with ACE cargo, which are currently not supported.

Example:
Load Sandbag Walls in Cargo Trucks
Drag and Position Sandbag Walls

### Add more slots to the mission
Since Comfy Downtime is getting a little crowded, it might make sense to increase the Slot count to an additional 10-15 Slots per Faction.

Blufor has the biggest importance, since this is the side that is played as the most.

### Add More Zeus slots
Since an increased amount of players is getting increasingly hard to handle with just 1 zeus, a second or more Zeus Slots would be preferred.

The Abuse aspect shall be handled the same way as people jokinly joining the Opposing side just to shit on the mission, essentially an instant kick/ban without warning.

### Rebuild mission.sqm File From scratch (EDEN)
Since EDEN introduced a new format, there have been slight issues with mission settings. When the mission gets upgraded, a complete Reubild of the mission.sqm file from scratch qould be advideable in order to ensure that no incompatibility happens.

The Initial Upgrade from 2d -> 3d Editor format happened when the EDEN Editor was in the Release Candidate branch.

### Incorporate new ACE 3.5 properties in the mission
Since the new Additions of ACE Settings hasn't been added yet, it's adviseable to rebuild the ACE settings modules so all the new Properties are getting added and properly configured.

ACE will in the future completely remove the ACE Modules (Version 3.6 or 3.7) and use the EDEN Properties.
Until that, the modules will have to be used.

### Add a Help Entry in the Briefing acting as a shortguide
Currently, most features of the mission are pretty much undocumented (For example, being able to move the initial Spawn by dragging the Whiteboard in Zeus, and the addition of the Advanced Slingloading Script)
